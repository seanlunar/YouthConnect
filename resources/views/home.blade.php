    <h1>Work<br />Stress</h1>
    <p>
      A counsellor can help you understand why you feel stressed and find
      strategies that can help you learn how to cope with stress. â€œTalking
      to a counsellor helps us go back to basics about how we are feeling
      when we're stressed, and why.

      You may be going through a new phase in your life, or having problems

      difficult situation. The idea of counseling is to have a third party
      who is outside of your circle of friends and family who can give you
      an objective.
